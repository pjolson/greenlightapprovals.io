Greenlight Approvals is a NetSuite-native application for approvals, budget enforcement, and audit-ready logging.

Use this section to orient new admins and finance leaders:

- How routing rules are configured across subsidiaries, departments, classes, and locations.
- How budget intelligence blocks overages before they post.

**Next steps**
