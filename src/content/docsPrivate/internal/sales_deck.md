This document provides the **text-only version** of the Greenlight Sales Deck.  
It includes the messaging, positioning, and narrative used in demos and customer presentations.

## 1. Opening Narrative

Greenlight Approvals is the modern approval engine built for NetSuite teams that have outgrown SuiteFlow, SuiteApprovals, and spreadsheet-based approvals.

It delivers:

- A clean, fast Approval Drawer built directly into transactions  
- Reliable, rule-driven workflows  
- Budget and AI insights for smarter decisions  
- Strong compliance with SoD and audit logging  
- A full Command Center for managers and finance leaders  

Greenlight becomes the approval system of record inside NetSuite.
