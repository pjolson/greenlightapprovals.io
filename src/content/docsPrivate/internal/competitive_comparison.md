## 2. Greenlight vs. SuiteApprovals

### 2.1 Summary

SuiteApprovals is widely deployed but extremely limited.  
Greenlight outperforms SuiteApprovals in every category except cost (SuiteApprovals is free).

**Greenlight Advantages**
- Modern Approval Drawer embedded in transactions  
- Budget Intelligence (Pro/Enterprise)  
- AI Insights (Pro/Enterprise)  
- True SoD detection & enforcement  
- Advanced logs + Timeline  
- Delegation (Enterprise)  
- Command Center dashboards  
- Faster rule matching & cleaner step design  
- Queue‑based processing for reliability  

**SuiteApprovals Weaknesses**
- No SoD  
- No budget context  
- No AI insights  
- No dashboards  
- Limited logs  
- No audit exports  
- Poor UI and confusing reliability  

### 2.3 Positioning Guidance

## 3. Greenlight vs. ApprovalMax

### 3.1 Summary

ApprovalMax is popular for QuickBooks and Xero but is not native to NetSuite.  
Greenlight’s native integration and compliance capabilities make it superior for all mid‑market and enterprise NetSuite users.

### 3.2 Capability Comparison

**Greenlight Advantages**
- 100% native NetSuite execution  
- Drawer UI inside the transaction  
- SoD enforcement (Enterprise)  
- Budget insights + AI insights  
- Immutable audit logs & Audit Package  
- No external data transfer  
- Command Center dashboards  
- Zero reliance on external servers  

**ApprovalMax Weaknesses**
- External system → approval data lives outside NetSuite  
- No inline Drawer  
- No true SoD  
- No budget narrative  
- Requires integration maintenance  
- Audit logs split between systems  

### 3.3 Positioning Guidance

**Use these statements internally**
- “ApprovalMax is great for accounting tools, but it’s not built for NetSuite.”  
- “Greenlight gives approvers context without leaving the transaction.”  
- “Compliance teams strongly prefer native logging inside NetSuite.”

## 4. Greenlight vs. Custom Workflows (SuiteFlow + Scripts)

### 4.1 Summary

Many customers rely on consultant‑built SuiteFlow workflows.  
They are brittle, expensive, non‑auditable, and difficult to maintain.

### 4.2 Capability Comparison

**Greenlight Advantages**
- No SuiteFlow  
- No script maintenance  
- Reliable queue‑based engine  
- Timeline + audit logs included  
- Debuggable exception system  
- Budget & AI insights  
- Centralized reporting & dashboards  

**Custom Workflow Weaknesses**
- Hard to maintain  
- No analytics or dashboards  
- No audit readiness  
- Breaks often after NetSuite updates  
- No visibility into logic for users/admins  

### 4.3 Positioning Guidance

**Use internally**
- “Greenlight replaces dozens of fragile SuiteFlows with a single engine.”  
- “Customers pay more maintaining custom workflows than for Greenlight.”

## 5. Greenlight vs. Email‑Only Tools

### 5.1 Summary

Email‑only tools offer lightweight convenience but lack governance, context, and auditability.

### 5.2 Capability Comparison

**Greenlight Advantages**
- Drawer summarizing everything in one place  
- Context from budgets, AI, SoD, and exceptions  
- Secure HMAC email approvals  
- Timeline + immutable logs  
- Manager dashboards  
- True workflow engine  

**Email‑Only Weaknesses**
- No context  
- No audit trail  
- No dashboards or workflows  
- Prone to unauthorized approvals  

### 5.3 Positioning Guidance

**Use internally**
- “Email approvals alone do not meet compliance requirements.”  
- “Greenlight adds governance without removing convenience.”
