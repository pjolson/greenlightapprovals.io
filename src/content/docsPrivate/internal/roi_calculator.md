## 2. Core ROI Categories

### 2.1 Approver Time Savings

**Formula**
- Time saved per approval × # of approvals per month × hourly rate  

**Assumptions**
- Drawer reduces approval time by 30–60%  
- Email approvals reduce time by another 20–40%  

### 2.2 Faster Approval Cycles

**Value Drivers**
- Reduced PO delays  
- Fewer vendor complaints  
- Increased on-time payment discounts  

**Formula**
- Days reduced × daily spend impact × % of transactions affected  

### 2.3 Reduced Audit Costs

**Value Drivers**
- Audit Package replaces manual sampling  
- Automated logs reduce audit prep time  
- Full SoD enforcement improves audit results  

**Formula**
- Hours saved × auditor hourly rate  

### 2.4 Risk Reduction (Unauthorized Approvals)

**Value Drivers**
- SoD enforcement blocks fraudulent approvals  
- Delegation rules prevent unqualified approvers  
- Exception detection prevents misrouted approvals  

**Formula**
- Historical issue cost × risk reduction probability

## 4. ROI Calculation Examples

### 4.1 Time Savings Example

**Inputs**
- 1 minute saved per approval  
- 8,000 approvals per year  
- $60/hour blended approver rate  

**Calculation**
- 8,000 minutes saved = 133 hours  
- ROI = 133 × $60 = **$7,980 per year**  

### 4.2 Audit Preparation Example

**Inputs**
- Audit prep currently 40 hours/year  
- Greenlight reduces by 50%  
- Auditor cost = $200/hour  

**Calculation**
- 20 hours saved × $200 = **$4,000 per year**  

### 4.3 Spend Leakage Example

**Inputs**
- Company overspends ~1% due to poor approval oversight  
- Annual spend: $10M  
- Greenlight reduces leakage by 0.3%  

**Calculation**
- 0.3% × $10M = **$30,000 per year**
