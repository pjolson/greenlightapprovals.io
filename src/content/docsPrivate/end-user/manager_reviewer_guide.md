Managers and reviewers use Greenlight to monitor approval progress, review exceptions, track performance, and ensure policy compliance.  
This guide explains the tools available to managerial users and how they differ from standard approvers.

## 1. Overview

Managers and reviewers can:
- Monitor approvals assigned to their team  
- Review timelines and comments  
- Identify bottlenecks or delays  
- Track exceptions and SoD warnings  
- View Command Center dashboards (if permitted)

Manager permissions vary depending on role configuration.
