The **Report Settings** record controls SLA timing, aging thresholds, performance scoring, and critical amount thresholds used across the Approval Drawer, Command Center, and audit outputs.  
This guide explains every field and how each value affects reporting.

## 1. Overview

Report Settings define how Greenlight evaluates:
- SLA timing and escalation expectations  
- Late and very late thresholds  
- Critical transaction amounts  
- Performance scoring bands  
- Aging buckets for Command Center analytics  

These settings influence dashboards, exception detection, and audit outputs.

## 2. SLA Configuration

SLA values determine how quickly approvers are expected to act and when an approval becomes “late.”

### 2.1 SLA Fields

**Fields**
- **SLA Target Hours** – Number of hours approvers have before the instance is considered late.
- **SLA Critical Hours** – Threshold at which an approval is considered very late.
- **Working Hours Only** – If enabled, SLA calculations exclude weekends and non‑business hours.

**Behavior**
- SLA is applied on step assignment.
- Late and very late indicators appear in the Approval Drawer and Command Center.

> **Tier Notes:**  
> All tiers display SLA-based timing. Enterprise includes advanced SLA analytics.

## 3. Late and Very Late Thresholds

Control warnings and escalation timing.

### 3.1 Threshold Fields

**Fields**
- **Late Threshold (hours)** – When an approval enters “late” status.
- **Very Late Threshold (hours)** – When an approval is critically overdue.
- **Escalation Offset (hours)** – Delay before escalation triggers after a threshold breach.

**Behavior**
- Thresholds appear as badges in the Drawer.
- Escalations are generated by the Escalation Engine scheduled script.

## 4. Critical Amount Thresholds

Defines high‑risk or high‑value transactions.

### 4.1 Critical Amount Fields

**Fields**
- **Critical Amount** – Amount that marks a transaction as high value.
- **Currency Mode** – Determines whether threshold is global or subsidiary‑specific.

**Behavior**
- High‑value transactions receive additional visibility in analytics.
- Critical status appears in drawers, logs, and Command Center.

> **Tier Notes:**  
> Critical amount warnings appear in all tiers. Enterprise may include expanded risk summaries.

## 5. Performance Scoring

Used to calculate individual and departmental approval performance in dashboards.

### 5.1 Performance Bands

**Fields**
- **Excellent Threshold (%)**  
- **Satisfactory Threshold (%)**  
- **Needs Improvement Threshold (%)**

**Behavior**
- Performance scoring affects Command Center leaderboards.
- Scores are computed from instance timing vs SLA.

## 6. Aging Buckets

Aging buckets categorize open approvals over time for dashboards and audit analysis.

### 6.1 Aging Bucket Fields

**Fields**
- **Bucket 1 (days)** – e.g., 0–3 days  
- **Bucket 2 (days)** – e.g., 4–7 days  
- **Bucket 3 (days)** – e.g., 8–14 days  
- **Bucket 4 (days)** – e.g., 15–30 days  
- **Bucket 5 (days)** – e.g., 30+ days (auto‑calculated)

**Behavior**
- Used in Command Center “Aging by Approver,” “Aging by Department,” and risk dashboards.

## 7. Exceptions Integration

Several exception types rely on Report Settings to determine severity.

### 7.1 Exception Dependencies

**Fields**
- SLA thresholds  
- Critical amount  
- Aging buckets  

**Behavior**
- Exceptions flagged by UE scripts reflect these thresholds.
- Exception severity escalates based on timing.

## 8. Troubleshooting Report Settings

### Common Issues

**SLA Not Calculating**
- Working Hours Only may cause unexpected timing.
- Verify time zone configuration in NetSuite Company settings.

**Aging Buckets Do Not Add Up**
- Ensure buckets are sequential and non‑overlapping.

**Critical Amount Not Applying**
- Currency settings may not match transaction currency.

**Command Center Showing Incorrect Buckets**
- Dashboard rebuild delayed by saved search caching.
- Check that Report Settings record was saved after changes.
