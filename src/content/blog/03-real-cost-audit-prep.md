A Controller I worked with once said: “For three weeks, my team does two jobs. Their actual job, and the auditor’s job.”

She wasn’t exaggerating. Every audit cycle they spent 40–60 hours pulling approval evidence. Not because approvals hadn’t happened — but because *proving* they happened (right person, right time, right amount) meant pulling data from system notes, spreadsheets, and policy docs by hand. Everyone talks about making approvals faster. Almost nobody talks about the cost of proving them after the fact.

**Where the time goes.** Auditors send a sample — 25 to 50 transactions, sometimes more. For each one your team needs full approval history: who, when, and whether the chain matched policy. In most NetSuite setups that means opening each transaction, digging through system notes for approval-related entries, and copying it into a spreadsheet. For 50 transactions that’s easily a day. Then cross-reference amounts and routing rules to confirm the approver was actually the right one. Then fill gaps when notes are ambiguous or something was approved outside the normal flow. Then format it the way the auditors want. Then do it again when they have follow-up questions.

**The math.** 40 hours per audit cycle at a blended $75/hr is $3,000 in labor. For SOX shops with quarterly testing, multiply by four — $12K+ a year just on approval evidence. And that’s before you count delayed closes and the fact that nobody wants to do this work.

**Why it’s this hard.** Most approval systems weren’t built with audit evidence in mind. They log to system notes — a general-purpose log mixed with every other change. Getting clean, structured evidence out often needs custom saved searches or manual compilation. The contrast: in a system designed for it, you open the approval audit report, filter by date and type, export. Five minutes instead of five days.

**What to ask.** Can you export a complete approval trail for any date range in under 10 minutes? Does it include *why* each person was in the chain (not just who)? If the answer involves “we run some saved searches and then…” you’re in manual territory. The answers tell you whether audit readiness was a design goal or an afterthought — and that’s what decides how your team spends those three weeks every year.
