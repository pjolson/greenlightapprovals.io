See how Greenlight Approvals transforms the NetSuite approval experience. Instead of hunting through subtabs and fields to make a decision, the Greenlight Tray puts everything approvers need in a single slide-out panel—right on the transaction.

**What’s in the tray**

- Decision context with the fields that matter
- Real-time budget intelligence
- A visual approval timeline showing where you are in the chain
- One-click approve or reject

Fully documented, fully auditable. Built natively for NetSuite.
