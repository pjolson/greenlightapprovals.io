## Current vs. Revised Pricing

### Tier Comparison

| Tier | Current Pricing | Revised Pricing | Change |
|------|----------------|-----------------|--------|
| **Core** | $399-$499/mo | $599/mo | +$100-200 (25-50% increase) |
| **Pro Compliance** | $899-$1,200/mo | $1,499/mo | +$299-600 (25-67% increase) |
| **Enterprise Governance** | $2,000-$3,500/mo | $4,500/mo | +$1,000-2,500 (43-125% increase) |

### Why the Increases Are Justified

**We're competing with:**
- Audit preparation firms: $50K per engagement
- Compliance consultants: $200-400/hour
- Manual CFO time: $150K+ salary
- Budget overruns: $100K-500K/year in wasted spend

**NOT competing with:**
- $99/month workflow tools
- Basic approval software

**NetSuite customers:**
- Already spending $100K-500K/year on NetSuite licenses
- Mid-market to enterprise ($10M-500M revenue)
- $1,500-4,500/month is a rounding error in IT budget
- ROI is immediate and measurable

### AI Assistant Add-On: $299/month (or Enterprise-only)

**Status:** Planned for Month 9 (July 2026)
**Architecture:** See `docs/architecture/11-ai-approval-assistant.md`

**What It Does:**
Contextual AI chat interface in approval tray. Approvers can ask natural language questions:

**Example queries:**
- "What's our budget utilization this quarter?"
- "How many times has this vendor been approved this year?"
- "Show me exceptions for this requester"
- "What's the average approval time for my department?"
- "What did the CFO say about the last request like this?"

**Value Proposition:**
- **Eliminates dashboard switching** - answers in context
- **Speeds approval decisions** - instant data retrieval
- **Reduces approval errors** - contextual warnings and insights
- **Conversational approvals** - makes process feel intelligent, not transactional

**Pricing Options:**
1. **$299/month add-on to Pro** - separate SKU, clear value
2. **Enterprise-only** - included in $4,500 tier as premium feature
3. **Usage-based** - $199 base + $0.10/query (covers API costs)

**Recommended:** Start as Enterprise-only to control costs and gather feedback, then offer as Pro add-on in Month 12.

**Competitive Moat:** No competitor will have this for 12-18 months. This is **v2.0 killer feature**.

---

### Planning Tool Connectors: $299-$499/month each

**Status:** Planned for Month 12 (October 2026)
**Problem:** Enterprise customers use Adaptive Planning, NetSuite Planning & Budgeting (NSPB), or other EPM tools instead of native NetSuite budgets.

**Solution:** Real-time API connectors that:
1. Query budget data from planning tool during approval
2. Display planning tool data in approval tray budget section

- Native SuiteScript integration
- Real-time budget queries
- No additional cost

#### Adaptive Planning Connector - $499/month

- Customer provides API credentials and endpoint mappings
- Query-only (no write-back)
- Works with Anaplan, Board, Host Analytics, etc.

**Target:** Enterprise customers who've invested heavily in planning tools and want unified approval + budget experience.

**Why They'll Pay:**
- Eliminates manual reconciliation between approvals and planning tools
- Single source of truth for spend decisions
- Makes Greenlight the "approval gateway" for all spend

**What It Is:**
- 2-week implementation timeline (vs 4-6 weeks standard)
- Dedicated implementation specialist
- 3 live training sessions
- Custom rule configuration (up to 10 rules)
- Testing and go-live support

**Partner Economics:**

---

## Modular Audit Package Strategy

### The Architecture

Replace hard-coded 7 CSV exports with **custom record-based report registry**:

**New Custom Record: `customrecord_gnl_audit_report`**

**Fields:**
- Report Name (text)
- Description (textarea) - shown in README.txt
- Saved Search ID (text) - reference to saved search
- Sequence/Order (integer) - controls export order
- Enabled (checkbox) - include in package or not
- Report Category (list) - Compliance, Performance, Audit Trail, etc.
- Default File Name (text) - CSV filename
- Tier Restriction (list) - Pro, Enterprise, Requires Pack

**How It Works:**
1. Ship with 7 default report records (Pro tier)
2. Enterprise gets 12 default records
3. Admin can add custom report records (Enterprise only)
4. Compliance packs add 6 report records each
5. One-click audit button reads enabled records, executes searches, generates ZIP

### Tiered Access Model

#### Pro Tier: 7 Default Reports (Fixed)
- Cannot add custom reports
- Can disable reports they don't need
- Can edit descriptions for context
- Ships with:
  1. Pending Approvals with Aging
  2. Approval Cycle Time
  3. Completed Approvals
  4. Configuration Changes
  5. Resubmissions
  6. Exceptions Report
  7. Complete Audit Log

#### Enterprise Tier: 12 Default + 5 Custom Slots
- Ships with Pro's 7 reports PLUS:
  8. Approver Performance Metrics
  9. Delegation Audit Trail
  10. Material Change Tracking
  11. Risk-Based Routing Analysis
  12. SLA Compliance Report
- Can add **5 custom reports** (via saved search reference)
- Unlocks "Add Report" button in settings UI

#### Enterprise + Compliance Pack: +6 Reports + 6 Slots
- Each compliance pack adds:
  - 6 pre-built report records (automatically enabled)
  - Unlocks 6 additional custom report slots
- Example: Enterprise + 2 Compliance Packs = 12 default + 12 pack + 17 custom slots = **41 total reports**

#### Enterprise Unlimited: $6,000/month
- No limit on custom reports
- For highly regulated industries or complex audit requirements
- Unlimited saved search references

### Why This Model Works

**For Customers:**
- ✅ Pro customers get proven audit coverage (7 reports) without complexity
- ✅ Enterprise gets flexibility to customize
- ✅ Compliance packs are "plug and play" - instant value
- ✅ Power users can build unlimited custom reports (at Enterprise Unlimited)

**For Revenue:**
- ✅ Compliance packs are high-margin add-ons ($399-499/month)
- ✅ Tiered slot limits create upgrade pressure
- ✅ Custom reports don't cannibalize pack sales (packs include expertise + pre-built)
- ✅ Modular architecture enables future packs (industry-specific, regional, etc.)

**For Partners:**
- ✅ Partners can build industry-specific report sets
- ✅ Differentiation opportunity ("We have our own Construction Industry Pack")
- ✅ Services revenue from custom report development

### Implementation Notes

See `BACKLOG.md` Task 5 for detailed implementation plan. Estimated effort: 6-8 hours.

**Key decision:** Should saved searches expose an "Include in Audit Package" checkbox that auto-creates report records?

## Competitive Positioning

### What We're Competing Against

#### 1. Native NetSuite Advanced Approvals
**Their Approach:**
- Basic workflow routing
- Requires Enterprise NetSuite license ($$$$)
- Limited reporting
- No budget integration
- No contextual decision support

**Our Advantage:**
- Works on all NetSuite editions (Starter to Enterprise)
- Budget integration (they can't match this)
- One-click audit package
- AI Assistant (coming)
- Unlimited approvers (they charge per-seat via license tier)

**Pricing:** We're cheaper and better (they require $50K-100K+ Enterprise license)

---

#### 2. Approval Workflow Tools (Kissflow, ProcessMaker, Nintex)
**Their Approach:**
- Generic workflow tools (not NetSuite-specific)
- Per-user pricing ($15-50/user/month)
- External systems (integration fees)
- No budget integration
- No NetSuite-specific compliance features

**Our Advantage:**
- Native to NetSuite (no integration, instant data access)
- Unlimited approvers (vs $5K-10K/month for 100 users)
- Budget integration
- Audit package
- NetSuite-specific rule engine (subsidiary, class, department, etc.)

**Pricing:** At 100 users, they're $1,500-5,000/month. We're $1,499 flat (Pro tier).

---

#### 3. Audit Preparation Firms
**Their Approach:**
- Manual audit prep ($50K per engagement)
- Consultants at $200-400/hour
- Spreadsheets and manual data exports
- Slow (weeks of work)

**Our Advantage:**
- One-click audit package (instant)
- Real-time exception detection
- Continuous compliance (vs point-in-time)
- Immutable audit logs (Enterprise)
- $1,500-4,500/month vs $50K one-time

**Pricing:** We save them $40K-45K per audit cycle. ROI in first year.

---

#### 4. Manual Processes (Spreadsheets + Email)
**Their Approach:**
- Free (but extremely expensive in time and risk)
- CFO/Controller manually tracking approvals
- Email chains and spreadsheets
- No audit trail
- Budget overruns common

**Our Advantage:**
- Saves CFO 10-20 hours/week (value: $30K-60K/year)
- Prevents budget overruns ($100K-500K/year savings)
- Instant audit trail (eliminates audit prep)
- Professional compliance documentation

**Pricing:** Even at $4,500/month Enterprise, ROI is 5-10x in year one.

---

### Why Our Pricing Is Still Conservative

**NetSuite ecosystem pricing norms:**
- Celigo integrations: $500-2,000/month
- Avalara tax: $500-3,000/month
- Coupa procurement: $50-100/user/month (= $5K-10K/month for typical company)

**Compliance software pricing:**
- LogicGate (GRC): $15K-50K/year
- AuditBoard: $20K-60K/year
- Workiva (SOX): $50K-150K/year

**We're at $1,499-4,500/month = $18K-54K/year**, which is:
- **Lower than standalone GRC tools** (and we do approvals better)
- **Comparable to other NetSuite ecosystem apps** (but we save more money)
- **10% of manual audit prep costs** (huge ROI)

**Bottom line:** We could charge MORE and still be a no-brainer purchase.

---

## Partner Economics

### Two-Track Model

#### Track 1: Referral Partners (10-20% one-time)
**For:** Individual consultants, occasional referrers, non-implementation partners

**Economics:**
- 10% one-time referral fee on first year contract value
- Example: Refer Pro customer ($1,499/mo) = $1,799 one-time payment
- No ongoing revenue share

**Why They Do It:**
- Easy money (just introduce customer)
- No implementation responsibility
- Low effort, decent payout

---

#### Track 2: Implementation Partners (25-35% recurring)
**For:** Implementation firms, traditional NetSuite partners, active sellers

**Economics:**
- 25-35% recurring revenue share on all subscription revenue (base + add-ons)
- Example: Implement Pro customer ($1,499/mo) = $375-525/month recurring
- Partner also earns services revenue (implementation, training, support)

**Why They Do It:**
- Recurring revenue stream
- Services revenue from implementation ($2,500-10,000 per customer)
- Ongoing consulting opportunities (optimization, training, custom reports)
- Builds long-term relationship with customer

**Partner Earnings Example (25% share):**
- 10 customers @ Pro ($1,499) = $3,748/month = $44,976/year
- Plus implementation services = $25K-100K one-time
- Plus ongoing consulting = $10K-30K/year
- **Total partner revenue: $80K-175K/year from 10 customers**

---

- Build case studies faster
- Create evangelists who've "been with you since the beginning"

**Cost:** Extra 5% revenue share (30% vs 25%) on early deals is worth the market validation and implementation feedback.

## Sales Enablement

### ROI Calculator Inputs

**Budget Savings Calculator:**
- Input: Annual budget, current overspend rate (%)
- Output: Annual savings from real-time budget visibility
- Formula: (Annual budget × Overspend rate × Prevention rate 80%)
- Example: $5M budget × 10% overspend × 80% prevention = **$400K saved**

**Audit Prep Savings Calculator:**
- Input: Annual audit frequency, hours spent on prep, loaded hourly rate
- Output: Annual savings from one-click audit package
- Formula: (Audit frequency × Hours × Rate) - (Greenlight cost × 12)
- Example: 2 audits × 100 hours × $150/hr = $30K - $18K Greenlight = **$12K saved**

**CFO Time Savings Calculator:**
- Input: CFO salary, hours/week on manual approvals, weeks/year
- Output: Annual value of reclaimed time
- Formula: (CFO salary × (Hours/week ÷ 40)) ÷ 52 × Weeks
- Example: $150K salary × (10 hrs/wk ÷ 40) ÷ 52 × 50 weeks = **$36K value**

**Total ROI:** Budget savings + Audit savings + CFO time = **$448K saved for $18K cost = 25x ROI**

### Sales Scripts by Tier

#### Core Tier Script (Small Business)
**Pain:** "We're tracking approvals in email and it's a mess. Auditors asked for an approval log and we couldn't produce one."

**Response:**
"That's exactly what Greenlight Core solves. You get unlimited approvers, email notifications, and a complete audit trail—all native to NetSuite. No more spreadsheets, no more lost emails. $599/month, and you can upgrade when you need advanced features like budget integration or compliance reporting."

**Objection:** "We only need simple PO approvals, can't we use a cheaper tool?"

**Response:**
"You could, but you'd pay per user ($50-100 each), you'd need integration fees, and you wouldn't have NetSuite-native data. At 10 approvers, other tools cost $500-1,000/month anyway. With Greenlight, you're $599 flat and you own unlimited approvers forever. Plus, when you grow and need budget controls, you just flip a switch—no migration, no re-implementation."

---

#### Pro Tier Script (Mid-Market CFO)
**Pain:** "We keep blowing budgets and only find out at month-end. Our CFO has to manually track spend vs budget in Excel."

**Response:**
"Greenlight Pro puts budget vs actual right in the approval tray. Before anyone clicks 'Approve' on a $10K purchase, they see: 'You're at 87% of Q4 budget, this puts you at 92%.' Approvers make smarter decisions in real-time, not after the damage is done. Plus, our one-click audit package generates 7 CSV reports for your auditors—instantly. You're saving $100K+ in budget overruns and $30K in audit prep, for $1,499/month."

**Objection:** "Can't we build this ourselves with saved searches?"

**Response:**
"You could try, but consider this: We've spent 200+ hours building the budget integration alone—connecting native NetSuite budgets, actual spend, period resolution, and subsidiary support. Our customers tell us they'd have spent $50K+ on a consultant to build this. And the audit package? That's another 80 hours of SuiteQL development. At $1,499/month, you get it all maintained, supported, and improved every quarter. Your NetSuite team stays focused on your business, not maintaining a custom approval system."

---

#### Enterprise Tier Script (PE-Backed / Public Company)
**Pain:** "We're going through SOX compliance and auditors want immutable approval logs, exception reports, and cross-subsidiary audit trails. We're paying $50K to consultants to prepare documentation."

**Response:**
"Greenlight Enterprise is built for exactly this. You get immutable audit logs with cryptographic integrity, modular audit package where you control exactly what reports go to auditors, executive dashboards for your board meetings, and cross-subsidiary approval routing. We've got customers who cut their audit prep from 10 weeks to 1 week. You're at $4,500/month—less than one week of consultant fees—and you have continuous compliance, not point-in-time prep. Plus, you get a dedicated CSM and 4-hour SLA guarantees."

**Objection:** "We already have a GRC tool (LogicGate, AuditBoard, etc.)"

**Response:**
"Those tools are great for risk management and control documentation, but they're not designed for real-time approval workflows in NetSuite. You'd need a custom integration ($50K+), and you still wouldn't have budget integration or contextual decision support. Greenlight is purpose-built for NetSuite approvals—native data access, zero integration fees, and we work alongside your GRC tool. Think of us as the 'operational layer' that feeds your GRC 'governance layer.' We make your GRC investment more valuable by giving you better data."

## Open Questions & Decisions

### Question 1: AI Assistant Pricing
**Options:**
1. Enterprise-only (included in $4,500)
2. $299/month add-on to Pro
3. Usage-based ($199 base + $0.10/query)

**Recommendation:** Start Enterprise-only for 3-6 months (beta phase), then offer as $299 add-on to Pro once costs and usage patterns are understood.

**Decision Date:** July 2026 (end of beta)

---

### Question 2: Core Tier Feature Limits
**Current thinking:** Core should be limited enough to create upgrade pressure, but robust enough to be useful.

**Proposed limits:**
- Single-step approvals only (no conditional steps)
- 4 dimensional matching (amount, department, class, location)
- No budget integration
- No audit package
- Basic audit trail (instance log only, no exceptions)

**Open question:** Is this too limited? Will customers feel "nickel-and-dimed"?

**Alternative:** Keep Core robust but position Pro as "where the magic happens" (budget + audit). Let Core be a genuinely good product that customers can live with, but Pro is where CFOs get ROI.

**Decision Date:** December 2025 (before new pricing launch)

---

### Question 3: Compliance Pack Bundling
**Option 1:** Sell packs individually ($399-499 each)
**Option 2:** Bundle packs (2 for $699, 3 for $999)
**Option 3:** "Compliance Suite" at $1,299/month (all current + future packs)

**Recommendation:** Start with individual packs (maximize revenue from single-pack buyers), introduce bundles in Year 2 when we have 5+ packs available.

**Decision Date:** April 2026 (compliance pack launch)

---

### Question 4: Partner Revenue Share on Add-Ons
**Current thinking:** 25-35% revenue share applies to all subscription revenue (base + add-ons)

**Alternative:** Lower revenue share on add-ons (15-20%) since partner involvement is minimal after initial implementation.

**Trade-off:**
- Higher share = partners incentivized to upsell add-ons
- Lower share = better margins for us on high-margin products

**Recommendation:** Keep full revenue share on add-ons. Partners should benefit from upselling compliance packs, AI assistant, etc. Their ongoing relationship with customer is valuable.

**Decision Date:** January 2026 (partner program documentation)

---

### Question 5: Enterprise Unlimited Pricing
**Proposed:** $6,000/month for unlimited custom reports in audit package

**Open question:** Is this too low? Should it be $7,500 or $10K?

**Alternative:** Make it usage-based ($4,500 base + $50/report/month over 20 reports)

**Recommendation:** Start at $6K flat (simple, predictable). If we see customers at 50+ reports regularly, raise to $7,500 in Year 2.

**Decision Date:** December 2025 (finalize tier structure)

## Summary & Key Takeaways

### What's Changing
1. **Core:** $399-499 → $599/mo (+25-50%)
2. **Pro:** $899-1,200 → $1,499/mo (+25-67%)
3. **Enterprise:** $2,000-3,500 → $4,500/mo (+43-125%)
4. **Add-ons:** New revenue streams (compliance packs, AI, connectors)

### Why It Makes Sense
- We're solving $100K-500K problems (budget overruns, audit prep)
- Competitors charge per-user (we're flat-rate unlimited)
- Native NetSuite integration is priceless (barrier to competition)
- Budget integration is genuinely unique in market
- NetSuite customers can afford it (already spending $100K-500K/year)

### What Stays The Same
- Feature-based pricing (not per-user) = key differentiator
- Clear value ladder (Core → Pro → Enterprise)
- Partner-friendly model (25-35% recurring revenue share)
- "Unlimited approvers" positioning

### Revenue Impact
- 40 customers: Old model = $410K ARR, New model = $668K-858K ARR
- 63-109% revenue increase with same customer count
- High-margin add-ons create predictable upsell path

### Biggest Strategic Bets
1. **Budget integration at Pro tier justifies $1,499** (vs $899)
2. **Modular audit package creates compliance pack upsell** (high-margin)
3. **AI Assistant becomes v2.0 killer feature** (12-18 month competitive moat)
4. **Founding Partner rates lock in early adopters** (feedback + case studies)

### What Could Go Wrong
- **Price resistance:** Mitigate with ROI calculator, case studies, founder-led sales
- **Core cannibalization:** Keep Core limited, emphasize Pro value (budget + audit)
- **Partner pushback:** Show them higher earnings at higher prices
- **Competitor response:** Our moats (budget integration, native NetSuite, AI) protect us

### What Success Looks Like
- Year 1: $220K-300K ARR (15-20 customers, Founding Partner rates)
- Year 2: $650K-850K ARR (40-50 customers, new pricing + add-ons)
- Year 3: $1.2M-1.5M ARR (80-100 customers, all add-ons, strong Enterprise adoption)
- Profitable with 2-3 employees by Year 3
- Acquisition interest at $1M ARR, strong interest at $2-3M ARR

**Bottom line:** This pricing strategy captures the value we're actually delivering, positions us as a compliance platform (not just approval software), and creates multiple high-margin revenue streams for sustainable growth.
